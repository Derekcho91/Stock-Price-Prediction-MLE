# Machine Learning Engineering Project Work
Hi, This is a School Project my group and I have done for a Machine Learning Engineering Module.

Generally Speaking, We are using AWS Lambda to start the EC2 instance to perform the webscrape from Yahoo Finance Frontend, And Feeding it thru AWS Sagemaker Endpoint to perform the prediction.

The Frontend is done via AWS Amplify.
